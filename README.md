# Nanopore-tools-comparison
We have conducted a primary comparison between DiffErr, DRUMMER, ELIGOS, nanom6A, MINES, and m6Anet on the HEK293T WT dataset (GSM3897645). 
tools.sh contains the commands used to preprocess the Hek293 direct sequencing data and run each tool.
All tools were run using default settings.
The results are summarised in a csv file hek293_wt.csv.
plot.R is used to generate a upset plot and a venn plot.
